# DevExtreme Angular List - Getting Started 

This repository stores code examples of the Angular List component for the [Getting Started with List](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/List/Getting_Started_with_List/) tutorial. The List displays data from a local or remote data storage and allows users to group, select, search, reorder, and delete items. This tutorial explains how to add a List to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.
